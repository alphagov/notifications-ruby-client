```

To get an API key, [sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __API integration__ page. You can find more information in the [API keys](/ruby.html#api-keys) section of this documentation.

# Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send text messages, emails or letters.

## Send a text message

### Method

```ruby
smsresponse = client.send_sms(
  phone_number: "+447900900123",
  template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
)
```

### Arguments

#### phone_number (required)

The phone number of the text message recipient. This can be a UK or international number. For example:

```ruby
phone_number:"+447900900123"
```

#### template_id (required)

Sign in to [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __Templates__ page to find the template ID. For example:

```ruby
template_id:"f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
```

#### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you must provide their values in a hash. For example:

```ruby
personalisation: {
  name: "John Smith",
  ID: "300241",                      
}
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

#### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

#### sms_sender_id (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification. You can find this information on the __Text Message sender__ settings screen.

1. Sign in to your GOV.UK Notify account.
1. Go to __Settings__.
1. If you need to change to another service, select __Switch service__ in the top right corner of the screen and select the correct one.
1. Go to the __Text Messages__ section and select __Manage__ on the __Text Message sender__ row.

You can then either:

  - copy the sender ID that you want to use and paste it into the method
  - select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service uses, and select __Save__


For example:

```ruby
sms_sender_id: "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one text message sender, or if you want to use the default sender.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client:ResponseNotification` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](/ruby.html#method), the object is named `smsresponse`.

You can then call different methods on this object:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`smsresponse.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|`smsresponse.reference`|`reference` argument|String|
|`smsresponse.content`|- `body`: Message body sent to the recipient<br>- `from_number`: SMS sender number of your service|Hash|
|`smsresponse.template`|Contains the `id`, `version` and `uri` of the template|Hash|
|`smsresponse.uri`|Notification URL|String|

If you are using the [test API key](/ruby.html#test), all your messages come back with a `delivered` status.

All messages sent using the [team and whitelist](#team-and-whitelist) or [live](#live) keys appear on your GOV.UK Notify dashboard.

### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client::RequestError` and an error code.

|error.code|error.message|How to fix|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`400`|`[{`<br>`"error": "BadRequestError",`<br>`"message": "Can't send to this recipient using a team-only API key"`<br>`]}`|Use the correct type of [API key](/ruby.html#api-keys)|

## Get the status of multiple messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 messages and statuses. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```ruby
args = {
  template_type: 'sms',
  status: 'failed',
  reference: 'your_reference_string'
  older_than: 'e194efd1-c34d-49c9-9915-e4267e01e92e'
}
response = client.get_notifications(args)
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next 250 oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

### Arguments

You can leave out these arguments to ignore these filters.

#### templateType (optional)

You can filter by:

* `email`
* `sms`
* `letter`

#### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: 'your_reference_string'
```

#### older_than (optional)

Input the ID of a notification into this argument. If you use this argument, the client returns the next 250 received notifications older than the given ID. For example:

```ruby

The client only returns notifications that are 7 days old or newer. If the notification specified in this argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty response.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client::NotificationsCollection` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](/ruby.html#get-the-status-of-multiple-messages-method), the object is named `response`.

You must then call either the `.links` method or the `.collection` method on this object.

|Method|Information|
|:---|:---|
|`response.links`|Returns a hash linking to the requested notifications (limited to 250)|
|`response.collection`|Returns an array of the required notifications|

If you call the `collection` method on this object to return a notification array, you must then call the following methods on the notifications in this array to return information on those notifications:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`response.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|`response.reference`| String supplied in `reference` argument|String|
|`response.email_address`|Recipient email address (email only)|String|

# Get received text messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 received text messages. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```ruby
args = {
  older_than: 'e194efd1-c34d-49c9-9915-e4267e01e92e'
}
response = client.get_received_texts(args)
```

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

If you leave out the `older_than` argument, the client returns the most recent 250 notifications.

### Arguments

#### older_than (optional)

Input the ID of a received text message into this argument. If you use this argument, the client returns the next 250 received text messages older than the given ID. For example:

```ruby
older_than: '8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2'
```

If you leave out the `older_than` argument, the client returns the most recent 250 notifications.

The client only returns notifications that are 7 days old or newer. If the notification specified in this argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty `collection` response.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client::ReceivedTextCollection` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](/ruby.html#get-received-text-messages-method), the object is named `response`.

You must then call either the `.links` method or the `.collection` method on this object.

|Method|Information|
|:---|:---|
|`response.links`|Returns a hash linking to the requested texts (limited to 250)|
|`response.collection`|Returns an array of the required texts|

If you call the `collection` method on this object to return an array, you must then call the following methods on the received texts in this array to return information on those texts:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`response.id`|Received text UUID|String|
|`response.created_at`|Date and time of received text|String|
|`response.content`|Received text content|String|
|`response.notify_number`|Number that received text was sent to|String|
|`response.service_id`|Received text service ID|String|
|`response.user_number`|Number that received text was sent from|String|

If the notification specified in the `older_than` argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty `collection` response.
